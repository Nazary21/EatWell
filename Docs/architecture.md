## State Management
- Using **Redux Toolkit** with TypeScript integration
- Modular state management with feature-based slices
- Typed hooks for type-safe state access
- Core state handling:
  - Loading states
  - Error management
  - Initialization tracking

### Store Structure
- Core slice for app-wide state
- Feature-specific slices (to be added as needed)
- Middleware configuration for async operations
- TypeScript integration for type safety

## Navigation Structure and Approach

### Expo Router Implementation
- File-based routing using Expo Router
- Root layout (`_layout.tsx`) with essential providers:
  - Redux Provider for state management
  - Paper Provider for UI components
  - Stack Navigator for main navigation

### Navigation Structure
1. **Root Layout** (`_layout.tsx`)
   - Manages providers and initialization
   - Handles app-wide navigation setup

2. **Tab Navigation** (`(tabs)/`)
   - Group for tab-based navigation
   - Will contain main app sections

3. **Stack Navigation**
   - Implemented at root level
   - Supports modal and stack-based navigation

### Navigation Features
- Type-safe routing with TypeScript
- Deep linking support (via Expo Router)
- Modal support for overlays
- Tab-based navigation for main sections

## Code Organization Principles

### 1. Feature-First Organization
- Features are self-contained
- Each feature can have its own:
  - State management (Redux slice)
  - Components
  - Types
  - Utils

### 2. Shared Resources
- Common utilities in `shared/`
- Reusable components (to be added)
- Global types and interfaces

### 3. Core Infrastructure
- Essential setup in `lib/`
- Store configuration
- Navigation setup
- Core providers

## Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Type-safe Redux usage with custom hooks
- Path aliases for clean imports
- Type checking for navigation

## Styling and UI
- React Native Paper for UI components
- Theme provider ready for customization
- Consistent styling approach (to be implemented)

## Future Considerations
1. **API Integration**
   - API client setup
   - Type-safe API calls
   - Error handling

2. **Authentication**
   - Auth flow implementation
   - Protected routes
   - Session management

3. **Performance**
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - State persistence
