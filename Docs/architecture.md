# Technical Architecture

## High-Level Architecture Overview

The application follows a modular, layered architecture that provides clean separation between frontend UI components and backend services. This approach enables:

1. Independent development of UI and backend integration
2. Robust offline capabilities
3. Centralized data handling and error management
4. Flexibility to change backend services without impacting the UI

### Layer Responsibilities

#### Front-end Layer
- User interface components and screens
- UI state management
- Design system implementation
- User interactions and input validation
- Client-side business logic

#### Backend Connection Sub-layer
- Isolates UI from backend services
- Centralizes configuration of all integrations
- Provides data consistency during offline operations
- Handles communication between frontend and backend
- Implements proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### Backend Services
- Database operations
- Authentication and authorization
- Third-party API integrations (OpenAI)
- Server-side business logic

## Implementation Strategy

The application will be developed in phases:

1. **Phase 1: UI-First Development**
   - Implement complete UI with mock data
   - Create frontend components and screens
   - Establish the design system
   - Setup local state management with contexts

2. **Phase 2: Connection Layer Implementation**
   - Build service classes for backend communication
   - Implement local storage for offline capability
   - Create synchronization mechanisms
   - Design fallback strategies for service unavailability

3. **Phase 3: Backend Integration**
   - Connect to real backend services
   - Implement authentication flow
   - Integrate third-party services
   - Deploy to production environments

This phased approach allows us to:
- Validate the UI and user experience early
- Establish a solid architectural foundation
- Add real backend services without major refactoring
- Maintain a consistent development approach throughout

## State Management

### Context-Based State Management
- Each feature domain has its own context provider
- Contexts expose state and actions to components
- Providers are combined in a unified AppProvider

### Data Flow

```
┌─────────────────┐       ┌────────────────────┐       ┌──────────────────┐
│   UI Components │       │  Context Providers │       │  Service Layer   │
│  (Consumers)    │◄────►│  (State & Actions) │◄────►│ (API/LocalStorage)│
└─────────────────┘       └────────────────────┘       └──────────────────┘
```

### Offline Support
- Local storage for data persistence
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Synchronization upon reconnection
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Backend Connection Sub-layer

The backend connection sub-layer is responsible for:

1. **API Communication**
   - Structured API clients for each resource type
   - Consistent error handling and logging
   - Request/response transformation

2. **Local Data Management**
   - Data persistence during offline usage
   - Cache management and invalidation
   - Schema migrations

3. **Synchronization**
   - Conflict detection and resolution
   - Queue management for pending operations
   - Data merging and reconciliation

4. **Error Management**
   - Graceful degradation during failures
   - Retry mechanisms
   - User-friendly error notifications

## Navigation Structure

### Expo Router Implementation
- File-based routing using Expo Router
- Root layout (`_layout.tsx`) with essential providers:
  - AppProvider for context-based state
  - Paper Provider for UI components
  - Stack Navigator for main navigation

### Navigation Structure
1. **Root Layout** (`_layout.tsx`)
   - Manages providers and initialization
   - Handles app-wide navigation setup

2. **Tab Navigation** (`(tabs)/`)
   - Group for tab-based navigation:
     - Home (Daily tracking)
     - Chat (AI assistant)
     - Insights (Analytics)
     - Profile (User settings)

3. **Stack Navigation**
   - Implemented at root level
   - Supports modal and stack-based navigation
   - Handles authentication flows and deep screens

## Type Safety
- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Type-safe context hooks
- Type definitions for API requests/responses
- Path aliases for clean imports

## Design System
- Comprehensive token-based design system
- Consistent theme across the application
- Responsive components for different screen sizes
- Light/dark mode support
- Accessibility compliance

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Component testing with Jest and React Testing Library
   - Service testing for backend connection layer
   - Context testing for state management

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Feature-based integration tests
   - Navigation flows
   - Context interactions

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Key user flows with Detox
   - Offline capability testing
   - Performance testing

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable application with a clear separation of concerns. By implementing the backend connection sub-layer, we ensure that the frontend can be developed independently of backend services while maintaining a consistent path for future integration.

The phased implementation approach allows us to focus initially on delivering a high-quality UI with local data before introducing the complexity of backend integration. This strategy provides early validation of the user experience while establishing the architectural patterns that will support the complete solution.
