# EatWell App Implementation Progress

## Latest Updates (Last Updated: March 16, 2025)

We've made significant UI improvements to enhance the visual consistency and user experience:

- Implemented custom UI components for a cohesive design system:
  - Created `StatsCard` for displaying daily calories and nutrition scores
  - Developed `MacroRatioCard` for visualizing macronutrient distribution
  - Built `AddFoodCard` with intuitive options for adding food entries
  - Designed `FoodEntryCard` for calendar-style food tracking
- Enhanced navigation experience:
  - Implemented custom SVG icons for tab navigation
  - Created a `SvgIcon` component for consistent SVG rendering
  - Optimized tab layout by removing the settings tab
  - Improved navigation bar styling and spacing
- Refined card styling and visual consistency:
  - Created `CustomSurface` component to eliminate unwanted shadows
  - Standardized card spacing with 16px gaps between elements
  - Fixed padding and alignment issues across all card components
  - Aligned timestamps with consistent formatting
- Added asset management:
  - Created organized directory structure for assets
  - Added placeholder images for food entries

## Previously Implemented

We previously implemented the backend connection sub-layer architecture while continuing UI development:

- Created a robust backend connection sub-layer with caching, offline support, and error handling
- Implemented service classes that follow the singleton pattern
- Added data synchronization for offline-to-online transitions
- Integrated contexts with the service layer while maintaining the same API for UI components
- Continued UI development with mock data while preparing for real backend integration

## Architecture Implementation

### âœ… Complete
