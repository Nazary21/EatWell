### 🔨 Iteration 5 - Project Cleanup and Structure
**Date**: 2024-02-27
**Time**: [Current Time] UTC
**Focus**: Cleaning up project structure and documenting working setup

**Changes Made**:
- Removed redundant `/app` directory from root
- Created comprehensive dependencies documentation
- Updated project status tracking
- Verified working Expo Router setup

**Files Changed**:
- Removed: `/app/index.js`
- Added: `/Docs/dependencies.md`
- Updated: `/Docs/Plan.md`
- Updated: `/Docs/Plan-report.md`

**Technical Decisions**:
- Standardized on TypeScript-based structure in `/src/app`
- Documented all working dependencies to prevent future conflicts
- Kept Expo SDK 49 for stability
- Maintained current routing structure with tabs support

**Challenges**:
- Had duplicate routing directories causing potential conflicts
  - Solution: Removed root `/app` directory, standardized on `/src/app`
- Watchman recrawl warnings in development
  - Solution: Documented fix in dependencies.md

**Next Steps**:
1. Set up Redux Toolkit store with TypeScript
2. Configure Supabase client with environment variables

- Implemented core state slice
- Created comprehensive architecture documentation
- Set up typed hooks for Redux

**Files Changed**:
- Added: `src/lib/store/index.ts`
- Added: `src/lib/store/hooks.ts`
- Added: `src/features/core/slice.ts`
- Added: `src/features/core/types.ts`
- Modified: `src/app/_layout.tsx`
- Added: `Docs/architecture.md`

**Technical Decisions**:
- Implemented feature-first architecture for scalability
- Used TypeScript for type safety throughout
- Set up modular store structure for better code organization
